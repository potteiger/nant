Ant's Editor -- Non-obfuscated
==============================

Ant's editor (`ant`) was "Best Utility" Winner of the 1991 International
Obfuscated C Code Contest (**IOCCC**).

`ant` is a tiny vi-like curses editor with an original source clocking in at
1478 bytes!

I am a huge fan of the IOCCC. Going over the most interesting winners over the
years is a big passtime for me. I get great enjoyment out of deobfuscating code
and seeing how it works. A lot of times these programs are impressive even
without the obfuscation. They're tiny but capable. And that's exactly what
`ant` is.

I believe "Ant" (Anthony C Howe) continued work on this editor after his IOCCC
win and later published non-obfuscated and improved versions himself. However,
I have not been able to find any copies of this source anywhere. Regardless,
I'm here for fun and a learning opportunity.

Sources
=======

 * `ant.c` is the original obfuscated source from the 1991 IOCCC. This will
   remain untouched and is here for reference.
 * `nant.c` is the non-obfuscated version I derived from `ant.c`.
 * `Makefile` builds both versions for testing. Should build on all modern Unix
 systems with `curses` library. Some Linux distributions may require `-lcurses`
 to be changed to `-lncurses` to compile.

```
# Original
make ant
./ant [filename]
# Non-obfuscated
make nant
./nant [filename]
```
